### 0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
* All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated. 
### 1. Base class
* Write the first class Base:
### 2. First Rectangle
* Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:
### 3. Validate attributes
* Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):
### 4. Area first
* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
### 5. Display 
* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
### 6. __str__
* Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
### 7. Display
* Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
### 8. Update
* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute:
### 9. Update
* Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes:
### 10. And now, the Square!
* Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle:
### 11. Square size
* Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size
### 12. Square update
* Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes:
### 13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation
* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle:
### 14. Square instance to dictionary representation
* Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square:
### 15. Dictionary to JSON string
* JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.
### 16. JSON string to file
* Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file:
### 17. JSON string to dictionary
* Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string:
### 18. Dictionary to Instance
* Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set
